# History Code Archive

This repository contains code I wrote in the past.  
It serves as a record of my early programming journey and learning progress.

## Structure

- `ZeroJudge/` – Solutions to problems from ZeroJudge, with filenames matching original problem IDs.
- `Coursework/` – Assignments from programming-related courses.
- `Unknown/` – Code files with unclear context, preserved for completeness.

## Notes

- Problem statements for many files are no longer available; code is preserved as-is with minimal formatting.
- This archive reflects early stages of learning and does not represent current coding practices or proficiency.
- Selected files may be annotated or revised over time as part of retrospective learning.
