# NTNU_Code_Archive

This repository preserves a large collection of code I wrote during my undergraduate studies in mathematics at NTNU.

## Structure

- `ZeroJudge/` – Solutions to problems from the ZeroJudge. File names follow original problem IDs where possible.
- `Coursework/` – Coursework submissions from programming-related classes.
- `Unknown/` – Code files with unclear problem context, retained for completeness and future annotation.

## Notes

- Problem statements for many files are no longer available. Code has been preserved as is, with minimal formatting cleanup.
- This archive is not intended to represent my current skill level but is retained as a record of foundational learning and progression.
- Selected files may be annotated or refactored over time as part of a code review and retrospective learning process.
